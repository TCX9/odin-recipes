    <p>This is my go to recipe for chicken tikka masala. It produces a creamy
        and delicious sauce with the correct amount of flavor. It is also versatile
        in that you can adjust the recipe to match your desired level of spicyness. 
        There is a marinade phase to this recipe, so definitely account for that. I 
        recommend a 6 hour marinade for the chicken.
    </p>
    <p>Ingredients list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Garlic Cloves, minced (a garlic press is fine)</li>
        <li>4 tsp. Finely Grated Ginger (leave this out if you don't like ginger)</li>
        <li>4 tsp. Ground Turmeric</li>
        <li>2 tsp. Garam Masala</li>
        <li>2 tsp. Ground Coriander</li>
        <li>2 tsp. Ground Cumin</li>
        <li>1&1/2 Cups Whole-Milk Yogurt (this can be tough to find but it is buried
            with the rest of the yogurts I promise)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken thighs. </li>   
        <p>Alternatively you can use
            boneless skinless chicken breasts but I prefer the thighs for this recipe.</p> 
        <li>3 tbsp. Ghee</li>
        <li>1/4  Cup Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>6 Cardamom Pods or alternatively ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. Crushed Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <p>This is where the spice adjustment comes in. You can up the amount of flakes or
            if you really want to you can substitute in dried arbol chiles. When making you 
            selection for how many you want. 2 will give a decent relatively weak spice but 
            still have something. 4 will get you some good spice and if you feel like, just
            keep upping it from there. It's your life after all, do what you want.
        </p>
        <li>1 28-oz. Can Whole Peeled Tomatoes, try to use <strong>San Marzano</strong></li>
        <li>3/4 Cups Chopped Cilantro</li>
        <li>Basmati Rice (however much you think you'll need)</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <p><strong>Preparation Phase:</strong></p>
        <li>Prepare you chicken thighs but removing the nastier gristley pieces.</li>
        <li>We will need an oven on broil during the simmer phase of the sauce,
            so plan accordingly, I recommend reading everything before cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Preparation: Combine your garlic, turmeric, garam masala, coriander,
            cumin, and cardamom (if you are using ground cardamom since you couldn't 
            find the pods). Combine the yogurt, salt, and half of that spice mixture 
            you just whipped up and coat your chicken.
        </li>
        <li>Toss that chicken in the refrigerator and let it marinade for 4-6 hours</li>
        <li>Open up your tomatoe paste and your whole peeled tomatoes.</li>
        <p><strong>Cooking Phase:</strong></p>
        <li>Heat your Ghee in a suitably large pot. Manage your heat for this part. Add 
            the onion, tomatoe paste, and cardamom pods (if you mananged to find them). 
            Stir often and once the tomato paste shows even an inkling of starting to darken 
            add the remaining half of the spice mixture. Keep stirring and as soon as you see 
            a hint of browning on the bottom of the pot, add the whole peeled tomatoes by
            crushing each one with your hand into the pot.
        </li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and let it simmer and 
            stir often. Let simmer for about 8-10 minutes
            until you start to see things thicken up.</li>
        <li>Add the cream and the cilantro, mix things up and then let the whole 
            mixture thicken up. Might take anywhere from 30-40 minutes depending
            on your heat management.
        </li>
        <p><strong>While your sauce cooks:</strong></p>
        <li>Preheat broiler if you haven't already done so. Line a baking sheet
            and toss your marinaded chicken thighs onto the pan. If you have 
            a wire rack, add that to the sheet as well. The marinade sort of
            disintegrates into a liquid while under the broiler. It isn't 
            mandatory to use the rack, I have done it both ways. The goal here is to broil
            until blackened spots begin to appear on the chicken (looking for
            that flavor). 
        </li>
        <li>Once those blackened spots appear, pull the chicken and cut everything 
            into bite size pieces. The chicken thighs will still be raw, they finish
            cooking in the sauce.
        </li>
        <p>What is missing from this recipe is the seriously charred aspect that
            is achieved with a tandoor oven. The broiler method won't really get 
            us where we want to be but it is convenient. If you would like to try
            and replicate the tandoor oven as best you can then I would go for a 
            charcoal grill brought to the hottest point you can manage and then
            char the chicken that way. The chicken should still be raw and then 
            just proceed wih finishing the chicken in the sauce as noted.
        </p>
        <li>Serve everything up with rice and enjoy!</li>
