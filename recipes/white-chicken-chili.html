    <p>All credit for this recipe goes to the folks at cookingclassy.com. It is hands
        down the best white chicken chili I have made to date. There are certain aspects
        of their recipe that I don't include and I have some tips and tricks for the recipe
        that makes things a little easier.

        <li>1/4 tsp. Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>8 oz Neufchatel Cheese (pay attention to the prep for this)</li>
        <li>1&1/4 cup Frozen Corn</li>
        <li>2 15 oz. cans Cannellini Beans</li>
        <li>2&1/2 cups Shredded Chicken (you can use rotisserie here if you want)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. Fresh Lime Juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. Chopped Cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Preparation Phase:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>If you didn't buy a rotisserie chicken then you will need to cook up some 
            chicken breasts. Make sure to filet the chicken breasts if they are thick 
            and salt and pepper before cooking. Try to get as much browning as possible on 
            on the chicken breasts. Once they are cooked, shred them.
        </li>
        <li>Dice your onion and mince up the garlic if you have not already done so.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse the beans. Set aside 1 cup of beans.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Cooking Phase:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat your oil in a large pot and saute the onion until tender and then
            add the garlic and saute for about 30 more seconds.
        </li>
        <li>Add the broth, green chilies, cumin, paprika, oregano, coriander, cayenne pepper,
            salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a low boil and then reduce the heat and 
            let it simmer for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>After the 20 minute simmer, add your 1 cup of beans to a food processor along
            with 1/4 cup of the sauce. Puree the mixture until is almost smooth.
        </li>
        <li><emp>Neufchatel Cheese:</emp> it is very important that you properly prep
        this cheese. If you do not bring the cheese to a high enough temperature before
        adding it to the sauce you will end up with a curdled mess that will ruin the dish.
        Cut up the cheese into cubes and then toss it in the microwave for 5-10 second increments 
        until the cheese is slightly warm to the touch.
        </li>
        <li>Add the Neufchatel cheese, corn, whole beans, and the puree. And then MIX, MIX, 
            MIX to make sure that the Neufchatel cheese with fully incorporate into the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Once everything is fully combined you can add the chicken, lime juice, and cilantro.</li>
        <li>That's it! Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
