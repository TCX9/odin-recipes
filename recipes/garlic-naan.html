    <h1>Garlic Naan</h1>
    <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F8665958.jpg&q=60&c=sc&orient=true&poi=auto&h=512">
    <p>The picture above is a realistic image of what the end product will actually
        end up looking like. This is the perfect supplement or addition to, the tikka
        masala recipe that I have listed. I still recommend you keep the rice of the 
        tikka masala as I think it is a must have item. However, you can feel free to
        substitute. I don't include in this recipe any additions to the naan. You can add 
        whatever you feel like to it. I recommend garlic butter and maybe some rosemary.

    <p><strong>Ingredients List:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp. Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. Baking Soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 Cups Warm Milk (I shoot for 90&deg;F)</li>
        <li>1/2 Cups Plain Yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Honey</li>
        <li>Canola Oil (for brushing)</li>
        <p>If you want to you can also make a quick garlic butter
            to go with it or add any sort of addition you feel like.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Preparation Phase:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine dry ingredients, flour, baking soda, baking powder,
            and salt into a bowl. 
        </li>
        <li>Combine your wet ingredients, milk, yogurt, honey into a 
            separate bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Add half the wet mixture to your dry mixture and Combine
            with a wooden spoon or your hands. Slowly start adding the 
            rest of the wet mixture while combining. The final result 
            will be an extremely sticky dough. We don't knead the dough
            at this point.
        </li>
        <li>Throw the dough into a well oiled bowl and let it sit for a 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li>After it sits for a bit, knead the dough with some flour to get rid of 
            the stickiness.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><Strong>Cooking Phase:</Strong></p> 
    <ol>

        <li>Split the dough into 8 balls and then, using a rolling pin, roll the balls
            into flat ovals. Try to make the ovals thin and uniform in thickness. There can 
            be some trial and error to get the thickness you might want.
        </li>
        <li>Heat up a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add a flavorless oil to the skillet
            and watching your heat, cook your ovals a couple of minutes on each side being careful
            not to burn them. The naan should bubble up and thats when you know its ready to be flipped.
            If you make the mistake of letting your oval be too thick then you may run into an 
            issue where you don't see any bubbling. Thats fine, just monitor the darkness of the 
            browning and flip when it starts getting close to turning black
        </li>
        <li>That's it! Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
